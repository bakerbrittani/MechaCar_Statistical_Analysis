## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![insertphoto](/MechaCarChallenge_MPG_Table_Linear_Regression_Summary.png)

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance when compared to the mpg values are vehicle_length and ground_clearance. 

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
No, the slope is not considered to be zero. The p-value of 5.35e-11 is much smaller than the significance level of 5%, which is enough to reject our null hypothesis.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
Yes. The r-squared value of 0.7149 indicates that we are approx. 72% confident that this linear model predicts the mpg of prototypes effectively, with consideration that we only compared to the 6 data points available. 


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

Does the current manufacturing data meet the design specification that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
